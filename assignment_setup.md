## 1, Object store path min/max analysis [Problem solving]
You have a specific prefix + key structure in your objects store (can be S3, HDFS, ...), that looks like this:
`protocol://bucket/base_path/specific_path/keys`  and a key has a structure of `id=some_value/month=yyyy-MM-dd/object{1, 2, 3, ...}`

Example:
s3://my-bucket/xxx/yyy/zzz/abc/id=123/month=2019-01-01/2019-01-19T10:31:18.818Z.gz
s3://my-bucket/xxx/yyy/zzz/abc/id=123/month=2019-02-01/2019-02-19T10:32:18.818Z.gz
s3://my-bucket/xxx/yyy/zzz/abc/id=333/month=2019-03-01/2019-06-19T10:33:18.818Z.gz
s3://my-bucket/xxx/yyy/zzz/def/id=123/month=2019-10-01/2019-10-19T10:34:18.818Z.gz
s3://my-bucket/xxx/yyy/zzz/def/id=333/month=2019-11-01/2019-12-19T10:35:18.818Z.gz

You have a function `get_all_keys(bucket, full_path) -> Iterator[str]` for getting all the keys for a full path (base_path + specific_path).

Notes:
On the input you know your bucket, base_path and all the specific paths you want to generate output for.
Also as shown in the example the month subkey has format of a date, but it's always yyyy-MM-01, so effectively it only gives you information about the year and month. Objects (files) within this structure have a timestamp, but this is a timestamp of when they have been created. For illustration, the last line in the example is an object (file) that was generated at '2019-12-19T10:35:18.818Z', but data in it are for the id of '333' and month of 2019-11.

**For each specific_path (there can be many):**
 - A, calculate for each id a minimum and maximum month (there cannot be gaps between moths)
 - B, write the output to a json file
 - C, (optional/bonus) there can be gaps between months (missing months), so report them also in some appropriate structure

### 2, Serving an ML model as an HTTP endpoint [Practical skill]
This task is about creating an application that sets up several HTTP endpoints with a well thought through structure. 

#### Endpoint 1
Imagine that you would like to serve newly trained sentiment analysis model via HTTP endpoint. The endpoint should accept requests with following structure:
```json
{
    "text": <str>,
    "languageCode": <str>
}

```
for example:
```json
{
    "text": "This task is awesome. Nope, just kidding.",
    "languageCode": "en"
}
```
and should respond with following response structure:
```json
{
    "sentiment": <"neutral" | "negative" | "positive">
}
```
A real model's output would obviously take into account what the input data is, but let's keep it simple and respond with a randomly chosen sentiment among the 3 choices stated above. 

#### Endpoint 2
Clients also want to provide feedback for incorrect prediction, which could be then used during retraining phase. To solve this create a third endpoint that would store incoming requests for further use, for simplicity we suggest storing it as files on the local file system. The request will be in following structure:
```json
{
    "text": "This task is awesome. Nope, just kidding.",
    "languageCode": "en",
    "sentiment": "negative",
    "isGoodTranslation": <true | false>
}
```
If this feedback is already stored, do not store it again. Think about how you would make your solution robust and maintainable (validation, logging, unit tests,â€¦).
You can use any language (Python/Java/Scala) and any framework that you are comfortable with (Flask/FastAPI/Spring Boot/...).
